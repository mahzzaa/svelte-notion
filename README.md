## Setup
All config is defined in site.config.ts.

1. Fork / clone this repo
2. Change a few values in site.config.ts
3. npm install
4. npm run dev to test locally
5. npm run deploy to deploy to vercel ðŸ’ª

I tried to make configuration as easy as possible â€” All you really need to do to get started is edit rootNotionPageId.

We recommend duplicating the [default page](https://tiodot.notion.site/5e19b09eec9e43c5b4c23031d41fea81) as a starting point, but you can use any public notion page you want.

Make sure your root Notion page is public and then copy the link to your clipboard. Extract the last part of the URL that looks like 7875426197cf461698809def95960ebf, which is your page's Notion ID.
